## Calem Bendell

* Spaceship infiltration with building and imbuement system.


## Monica Pabin

* Collector/defender with helpless collector.


## Shivani Sharma

* Collector/defender with capable defender and some time travel elements.
  * Players collect resources and powerups through various stages before encountering a boss.  
  * Players can time travel back to the first stage to redo the stages to become stronger.  When reaching the boss the second time, the boss is stronger and/or multiplied.
  * Alternative idea:  The boss is too strong on the first encounter, so the Players must time travel back to collect specific items to beat the boss.  When encountering the boss again, the boss is the same difficulty level as the first encounter.


## Marc Jarvis

* Asymmetric goal prison escape with space travel and ship choices.

## Monica Ung

* Each player has only one ability.  
  * Player A's ability is to cast a spell to transform Player B into another form. 
  * Player B can do one certain type of attack/move depending on what form he is in.  
  * Character progression: Player A can collect more spells to cast the other player into new forms.  Player B's attack/action becomes stronger as it kills more enemies.

* Only certain players can see certain enemies. Example:
  * Player 1 can see ghouls in another dimension and those monsters are slowly eating away the life out of Player 2 but Player 2 can't see nor get rid of those enemies.  
  * Player 1 has to prevent the enemies from killing Player 2, and Player 2 is the only one with the ability to destroy a main enemy that could be the source of the ghouls.  
  * Another idea to throw at this is that both Players have to share the same weapon to attack the two different enemies (boss + ghouls).  When Player 2 passes the weapon to Player 1, he can see/go into the other dimension and shoot the ghouls.  
  * Character progression: Player 2 can be slower and sluggish over time since his energy is slowly being drained by the ghouls and Player 1's vision/stability can get more distorted the more times he switches between dimensions.  Players can use items to heal themselves from the negative effects to prevent the game from becoming unplayable over time.
