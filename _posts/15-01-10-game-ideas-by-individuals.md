### Core

A Spaceship infiltration with building and imbuement system.
Core game is semi-isometric hack and slash.

+ Class One
  + Light and fast with two knives, ability to dodge and sprint
  + Can create blocks that can be placed within the world
+ Class Two
  + Heavy but with some psionic abilities such as a blast and teleporting
  + Can imbue blocks with certain properties including explosiveness, gravity locking, and hardened

### Levels 

First level with closing off the hull through gravity locked blocks.
Other levels should include building a bridge.
Survival round in which extra points are given for killing fewer enemies, which can be achieved through quick and clever use of building.

### Player characters

The first character is a very fast fighter with a quick melee weapon, perhaps dual knives of some sort, a stealth mode, and the ability to leap and roll.
The player should feel the character has superhuman agility, and an expert should be able to completely avoid being caught or damaged unless she's surrounded. 
Abilities:

+ Roll
+ Quick hit
+ Slashing Dash
+ Create object (building block)
+ Control object (move object with right joystick, move player with left joystick)
    + Toss object (Y)
    + Push object (X)
    + Pull object (B)
    + Use object  (A) 

The second character is somewhat slower but has psionic/metacosmic abilities.
Since it's a short game, we don't even have to explain these, yay!
Some abilities that should be implemented for a functional character:

+ Teleport: short
+ Teleport: long
+ Area blast
+ Direct blast
+ Create object (psionic energy ball, can be used to freeze building blocks in a particular place)
+ Control object (move object with right joystick, move player with left joystick)
    + (same as above)

* Collector/defender with helpless collector.


## Shivani Sharma

* Collector/defender with capable defender and some time travel elements.
  * Players collect resources and powerups through various stages before encountering a boss.  
  * Players can time travel back to the first stage to redo the stages to become stronger.  When reaching the boss the second time, the boss is stronger and/or multiplied.
  * Alternative idea:  The boss is too strong on the first encounter, so the Players must time travel back to collect specific items to beat the boss.  When encountering the boss again, the boss is the same difficulty level as the first encounter.


## Marc Jarvis

* Asymmetric goal prison escape with space travel and ship choices.

## Monica Ung

* Each player has only one ability.  
  * Player A's ability is to cast a spell to transform Player B into another form. 
  * Player B can do one certain type of attack/move depending on what form he is in.  
  * Character progression: Player A can collect more spells to cast the other player into new forms.  Player B's attack/action becomes stronger as it kills more enemies.

* Only certain players can see certain enemies. Example:
  * Player 1 can see ghouls in another dimension and those monsters are slowly eating away the life out of Player 2 but Player 2 can't see nor get rid of those enemies.  
  * Player 1 has to prevent the enemies from killing Player 2, and Player 2 is the only one with the ability to destroy a main enemy that could be the source of the ghouls.  
  * Another idea to throw at this is that both Players have to share the same weapon to attack the two different enemies (boss + ghouls).  When Player 2 passes the weapon to Player 1, he can see/go into the other dimension and shoot the ghouls.  
  * Character progression: Player 2 can be slower and sluggish over time since his energy is slowly being drained by the ghouls and Player 1's vision/stability can get more distorted the more times he switches between dimensions.  Players can use items to heal themselves from the negative effects to prevent the game from becoming unplayable over time.
