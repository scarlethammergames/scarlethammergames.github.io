## Storyline

Group of skilled people crash landed on alien planet on an escape pod far away from home.  Cause for being away from home planet may be natural disaster, accident during an expedition, attack by marauding parties etc.  Crash survivors must repair and refuel ship in order to make it back to home planet.  Their vehicle has limited range, thus our characters will have to make multiple stops to refuel their spacecraft.  Fortunately, there are many somewhat inhabitable planets between crash landing site and home planet that have the fuel that's needed.  A secondary objective of the game is to build communication beacons on each planet
