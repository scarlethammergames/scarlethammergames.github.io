The white rabbit.
Here is a list of some of the rabbits we could pull out of our designer's magical top hat.

## Cooperative Rope Walking

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons

## Ghost with Visibility Goggles

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons

## Building Blocks with Imbuement

>  Originally by me but I find the gravitational singularities to be more interesting and probably even easier to implement.  This could be interesting regardless and could be considered in another light where one player can imbue the weaponry of the others. - Calem

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons

## Cooperative Gravitational Singularities

### Summary

Players get a singularity tool that can produce singularities that either push or pull all objects within a sphere of influence.
The map would preferably be prepared to be interactive with this weapon.
For the ice planet, this could be as simple as pre-subdividing the terrain mesh into large icy chunks and into ice shards that can damage enemies.

Interesting physics based puzzles become available.
In the prototype, this was used to traverse a bridge of objects trapped between to singularities.
Another mode is allowing a double jump by jumping onto the top of a singularity, which pushes the character up or allows them to walk on top of the sphere of influence depending on the gravitational factor.

### Pros

+ Very easy to implemented if the prototyping is any indication
+ Adds much more interest to level design
+ Purely physics based cooperation and problem solving, which should be very intuitive, deterministic (like Portal)
+ No particularly special considerations for AI
+ Concept has been tested for resource usage and does well without optimisations

### Cons

+ Would require level design considerations beyond normal puzzle making (subdivisions)
+ Fine control of singularity location may be awkward (though could be easy if both joysticks used in fine control mode?)
+ Syncing physics of multiple bodies between players may be difficult and needs to be tested.

## Transition into spirit with different environmental interactions

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons

## Time travelling with effects on past

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons

## Collector and defender with pinging for resource collection

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons

## Single item to share

### Summary

> The mechanics of this need to be fleshed out more, I think.   - Calem

### Pros

### Cons

## One player can transform the other, changing their abilities

### Summary

### Pros

### Cons
